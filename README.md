In this project I developed a veeeeery simple chatbot using python and a library called NLTK which is very common in NLP projects. This chatbot is quite simple and intuitive, and can serve as an understanding basis of the logic behind chatbots.

In a future project I will create a more complex chatbot, perhaps using openai API and more advanced tools. I had fun with this and it is good to practice python and string manipulation too.
